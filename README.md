# Calcium-Dependent-Synapse-Transmission
Implemented a computational model of calcium-dependent synaptic transmission to analyze the nonlinear 
relationship between presynaptic calcium dynamics and synaptic release probability.
This project explores calcium-dependent synaptic transmission using a simplified computational model.
The goal is to understand how intracellular calcium dynamics influence neurotransmitter release 
and synaptic response, a key mechanism underlying neuronal communication.

## Background
Synaptic transmission is critically regulated by calcium ions (Ca²⁺).
An increase in presynaptic calcium concentration triggers vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release.
Modeling this process computationally helps bridge biological mechanisms with quantitative analysis.

## Objective
- To simulate calcium-dependent synaptic behavior using a computational approach
- To study how variations in calcium concentration affect synaptic output
- To visualize synaptic response dynamics over time

## Model Overview
The model captures:
- Calcium influx following presynaptic activity
- Calcium-dependent modulation of synaptic efficacy
- Temporal evolution of synaptic response

The simulation focuses on understanding trends and qualitative behavior rather than detailed molecular kinetics.

## Tools Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Results
The model demonstrates that increased intracellular calcium levels lead to enhanced synaptic response,
while reduced calcium availability suppresses neurotransmitter release.
Visualizations highlight the strong dependence of synaptic strength on calcium dynamics.

## Significance
This project provides insight into the computational principles governing synaptic transmission
and serves as an introduction to modeling biologically realistic neural processes.
It aligns closely with research in computational and synaptic neuroscience.

## Motivation
This work was undertaken to develop a deeper understanding of how biological synaptic mechanisms
can be represented and analyzed using computational and data-driven methods,
bridging neuroscience with quantitative modeling.
